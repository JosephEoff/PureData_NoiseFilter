#X text -102 4 The BandlimitedNoisefilter uses two 10th order Butterworth
filters as a band pass to select the range of frequencies to be sent
through a NoiseFilter.;
#X text -98 115 The inlets from left to right are:;
#X text -98 135 1 Audio signal;
#X text -98 155 2 Lower cutoff frequency;
#X text -98 175 3 Upper cutoff frequency;
#X text -98 195 4 Noise supression level - higher values mean less
noise. Too high will destroy your audio signal.;
#X text -100 68 The BandlimitedNoiseFilter has four inlets and three
parameters.;
#X text -98 246 The parameters from left to right are:;
#X text -98 266 1 Lower cutoff frequency;
#X text -98 286 2 Upper cutoff frequency;
#X text -98 306 3 Noise suppression level compensation. This value
is needed when using multiple bands. The simple NoiseFilter is more
effective at higher frequencies \, which results in the low frequencies
being over emphasized. Use lower values for the higher frequencies.
See the MultibandNoiseFilter for an example.;
