#X text 40 163 The MultibandNoiseFilter has two inputs. The left input
is the audio to be processed. The right input sets the level of noise
suppression. The higher this value is the more noise will be removed.
If this number is too high \, then the filter will start removing parts
of the signal.;
#X text 40 17 The MultibandNoiseFilter suppresses noise over the entire
range from 40Hz to 22000 Hz. The MultibandNoiseFilter uses 18 BandlimitedNoiseFilters
to remove noise from the audio signal. The use of multiple bands allow
one area to be filtered out completely while still allowing audio in
other areas. Multiplebands also make it possible to tailor the filtering
action across the entire bandwidth.;
