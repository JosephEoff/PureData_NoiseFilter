#X text 15 309 2 Noise suppression level.;
#X text 12 10 The NoiseFilter determines the current amplitude of the
audio signal in dB. This volume level is then passed through a high
pass filter so that only changes in the volume level cause a change
in the amplification in the final stage before the outlet. The result
of this is that sounds with a more or less constant volume result in
an amplification factor close to zero. This removes constant white
noise as well as continuous sounds (sine wave \, whistle \, hum \,
etc.) The NoiseFilter is more effective at higher frequencies \, making
it advisable to use multiple filters with lower supression levels for
the higher frequencies if you need to filter a large frequency range.
